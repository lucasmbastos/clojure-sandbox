# Clojure Sandbox

Personal repository to test clojure techniques and exercises. Feel free to read, fork, etc.

## Usage

For now, all files inside `src` can be loaded inside REPL. Each file alone contains a set of exercises grouped by some
subject, you need to read the code, run file and read output to get fully understanding of what these exercises mean.

### Loading Files in REPL using _JetBrains IntelliJ_

In order to use _IntelliJ_ to develop Clojure, you will need to donwload _Cursive_ plugin. Checkout on [their website](https://cursive-ide.com/) how to do it. You will be requested to input a license after 30 days trial, cursive has a free personal license available. I'm using this free license to make these exercises :)
