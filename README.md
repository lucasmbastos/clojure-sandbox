# `clojure_sandbox`

Personal repository to test clojure techniques and exercises. Feel free to read, fork, etc.

## Usage

For now, all files inside `src` can be loaded inside REPL. Each file alone contains a set of exercises grouped by some
subject, you need to read the code, run file and read output to get fully understanding of what these exercises mean.

### Loading Files in REPL

* Linux: `alt + shift + L`
* Mac: `control + shift + L`
